    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in 2022, I did a Suricon presentation titled [Jupyter Playbooks for Suricata](https://youtu.be/hevTFubjlDQ). The goal of that presentation was to introduce JupyterLab to security practitioners who work with Suricata. Many people are familiar with exploring Suricata EVE output using established technology stacks such as Elastic stack, Splunk, etc. Yet might be unfamiliar with tools from data science world. Amazingly, a lot of people are still totally unfamiliar with EVE NSM data. It's 2023 and Suricata is still considered by many to be only a rule based IDS, even going so far that Suricata is often deployed in tandem with NSM logging tools as people believe Suricata is unable to fill the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "To amend the situation, the presentation was focused around use-cases around exploring Suricata EVE JSON logs. It attempted to bridge a gap between threat hunting and data analysis, communities that have large overlap in what they do, yet remain quite far separated. It also attempted to highlight useful insights that can be extracted from EVE NSM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original presentation resources can be found [here](https://github.com/StamusNetworks/suricata-analytics/blob/main/jupyter/Notebooks/Suricon2022Talk.ipynb). Since the presentation was about Jupyter notebooks, and Jupyter notebooks are by nature interactive, then it made no sense to me to format it as simple slideshow. In fact, notebook proved to be quite flexible presentation environment, and it turned the talk into one big tech demo. Perfect for a technical community conference. Input data was drawn from public sources, meaning anyone could run the notebook and repeat everything shown on stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "That notebook was meant to be used as a resource. One that anyone could access and use as a reference for analyzing Suricata EVE logs. However, as anyone familiar with doing presentations knows, the challenge is not creating content. It's fitting what you have into the time window. A 45 minute tech talk really does not leave enough time to properly explain important concepts, especially if the audience is unfamiliar with talking points. Many ides were cut, others were explained quickly to move forward to interesting sections. Each pseudo-slide also needed to be readable, meaning no extensive *walls of text* as they would simply not fit the screen. The fact is, what works in a technical writing does not work for presenting. And vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution - write a extended notebook. More topics, more examples, and more context around each code cell. We will also section off the notebook into smaller blog posts for those not interested in interacting with notebook itself. Eventually it will formulate a series describing most important topics covered by the notebook. Why *most*? Because notebook can keep evolving over time, adding sections, improving examples, and maybe even reworking entire sections."

    "## About Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), born out of IPython Notebooks project, promotes open standards for interactive computing. Jupyter notebook is built on IPython kernel for running computations on interactive code inputted by the user, and outputs the results of those computations. In addition to code and output, user can also write markdown text to document each step. Hence the *notebook* moniker. Quick code to feedback loop makes Jupyter notebooks perfect for experimentation and documentation. It has become the de'facto tool for data scientists for this very reason. *Kernels* for many languages are supported. For example, [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/) and [many more](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)."

    "### Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is organized into *cells*. Those cells are generally executed from top to bottom, but can also be evaluated individually by the user. A cell can contain either `code` or `markdown`, but not both. "

    "#### Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell is similar to simple IDE, as it allows programmer to write code while also providing syntax highlighting and autocompletion. A code cell, unlike a typical script file, can be executed individually. In other words, cells *should* be evaluated sequentially but user is free to jump to earlier cell while retaining variables in memory that were created by latter cells. Whenever a code cell is executed, it displays return value of last line of code withing that cell. Simple variables can even be called with no additional printing or formatting code, as notebook automatically catches the return value. It even has built-in display formatting for data frames. More on that later."

    "#### Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "A *kernel* lies at the core of code evaluation loop. Jupyter itself is written in Python and [IPython](https://ipython.org/) is the default kernel it was built around. However, users can install any number of kernels for different languages. Those kernels can vary in maturity and quality. Don't be surprised when a kernel for your favorite language is missing basic features such as syntax highlighting or code suggestions. A custom kernel simply might not support those features yet. Some kernels might even be missing basic language features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel is chosen when first creating a notebook and can not be changed later. Using multiple kernels in a single notebook is not currently possible. Nor is it possible to change a kernel of existing notebook."

    "#### JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "*IPython notebook files* that use `.ipynb` file extension are generally considered to be the *Jupyter Notebooks*. However, the original web interface created for interacting with them is nowadays also often referred to as *jupyter notebook*. Reason is likely to distinguish that interface from [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html), an advanced interface with IDE-like features. Such as tabs, splits, variable exploration, extensions, and more. Old interface simply focused on interacting with a single notebook. A notebook *file* can be edited with both interfaces. There are no compatibility differences. JupyterLab simply provides a more extensive (but also more complex) interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab instance can be launched with `jupyter lab` command while legacy interface can be executed with `jupyter notebook`. Nowadays most projects default to using lab over simple notebook editor, but many people might still prefer the simplicity of the old interface. Might be worth considering when only getting started."

We start with a simple one that contains web scanning and [Log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) CVE exploitation attempts. As any server administrator knows, website scanning is not really interesting traffic. It is inevitable when hosting any public services, scanning and exploitation attempts are fully automated by the malicious *spiders*. Think of it as malicious version of Google indexing your pages.

    "Jupyter supports *magic* commands, either via built-in functions or calling shell commands. Exclamation mark as first symbol in the cell signifies a shell command. You can also use variables, though I imagine more complex logic will quickly become messy. Those magic commands are simply meant to be used for saving time on basics. Real power of a notebook still lies in all the options it gives the user for analyzing the data. And custom code enables that. Notebook users want to start analyzing data as fast as possible, so calling a familiar command instead of writing custom code can be a huge help."

    "#### Updating Suricata rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting the code cell with percentage sign `%` invokes built-in functions. Again, it is a method for saving time on basic tasks. Jupyter has commands for loading python file content into a code cell, measuring execution time, installing python dependencies etc. Dependency install is especially useful in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with Suricata eventually requires downloading and customizing rule files. Initial ruleset setup is quite easy, but maintaining it daily is a lot more difficult. Not every signature is meant to provide useful info in every environment. Alerting on a UNIX ping on a secure subnet that should only have Windows devices can be a red flag, but the same rule on a typical Linux server subnet is just a source of noise. A Linux system administrator would likely want to disable that rule, and ensure it remains disabled when ruleset is updated the next day. For a long time, this was out of scope for the main project and people had to resort to using legacy tools or custom scripts for downloading, updating, or modifying their rulesets.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Suricata Update](https://suricata-update.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a command-line rule management tool developed and maintained by OISF. It comes bundled with Suricata, assuming it's built with all python tooling correctly enabled. But it can very easily installed individually, as just like Jupyter, it too is written in python. Jupyter builtin `%pip` command turns out to be very useful here, as we can ensure it's installed with minimal effort. Directly from the notebook. Makes it pretty handy for ensuring that notebook uses correct ruleset, without actually bundling the rules with notebook itself. File paths and software licenses can be a pain to deal with."

    "Once suricata-update is installed, we can use it to enable rule sources, apply rule modification or disable overrides, and update our ruleset itself.

But it can highlight useful events that might go unnoticed with core Emerging Threats Open. For demonstration, the following cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "* list available public sources to see what can be enabled;\n",

    "#### Parsing the PCAP with Suricata\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set up our rule file and downloaded a PCAP to analyze, we can now proceed with parsing it with suricata. Most people know that Suricata can read PCAP files offline with `-r` flag. Not many are aware that Suricata logging directory can be overridden using `-l` flag and that Suricata can be pointed toward a rule file with `-S` or `-s` flags. Capital `-S` means exclusive rule file, meaning all rule files configured in `suricata.yaml` are ignored. Lowercase `-s` adds that file to list of files already in the main configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want predictable output for the notebook, so we choose exclusive load. We also clean any existing logs from the logging directory, so we ensure that it's fully recreated. Suricata would append logs to any existing PCAP files, meaning rerunning the code cell would create duplicate events."

A lot of things can go wrong when loading rules. A variable can be missing, keyword might be unsupported, or home networks might be incorrectly set up. Former issues would cause errors while loading rules, and problematic rules would be skipped. Last issue, misconfigured home network, is an oversight and rules would simply not trigger. However, those issues are not fatal. Suricata would still start up and produce NSM events, even without a fully functioning ruleset.\n",

    "### Dataframes and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is great for building applications and for security analytics. It is structured and most modern no-sql databases default to using it. Nowadays, security analysts are used to reading it. Data scientists and data engineers, however, working with tabular row-column data. Most data mining and machine learning algorithms work on data vectors or matrices, with a matrix essentially just being a vector of vectors. For statistical analysis, those vectors usually contain floating point numbers - some kind of numeric measurements. Each vector would make up a column of data within the matrix, and complex calculations are carried out on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes multiple columns are combined to transform raw data into more meaningful context. For example, Suricata measures request and response bytes separately, and analyst might want to sum up those columns. Other times a vector would be scaled or normalized, as measurements might be on different scales and would thus not be directly comparable. For example, defining a generic threshold is very difficult as traffic scale and patterns differ greatly between organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column of data might not be numeric measurements, but rather textual values, booleans, timestamps, categories etc. This is usually the case with NSM data. A classical matrix stores only one *type* of data, usually numbers. A *dataframe* is basically a matrix where each column can be of different type. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data analysis and manipulation library that brings dataframes to Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting started with dataframes is quite simple. The challenge is changing the mindset. Coders experienced in imperative languages might need to relearn what they already know. Statistical analysis is centered around vectors, rather than individual elements. Furthermore, API-s are often declarative and follow functional programming paradigms. Basically, you need to drop the *for loop* and learn how to *apply* functions instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason is performance. CPU-s are really efficient at crunching numbers and SIMD instructions speed up calculations by orders of magnitude. Even the smartest code has a hard time competing with that. Data science libraries in high-level languages such as Python often function as interfaces. They give the user an extensive API that's intuitive to use, yet actually defer the calculations to low level code written in C or C++ that are able to leverage optimized CPU instructions or even GPUs. In other words, passing a vector of data means it might be handled by efficient machine code, whereas looping over items in Python means they will be always evaluated by Python. A language notorious for being slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Suricata data, we're mostly working with textual values that would firstly need to be converted into numerical measurements before such gains could be made. Hence, we likely won't see a huge performance increase doing things the *pandas way* rather than *python way*. In fact, sometimes it will be faster to just convert data between python objects and native python data structures, especially when fast random lookup is required (lists are really bad at that). This is a challenge when combining NSM data with data science tools. Concessions need to be made on both sides. Data science tools are not better nor worse than tech stacks that are well established in security. They simply open new possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of choosing pandas over native python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas implements a ton of useful methods for working with and filtering data;\n",
    "* Pandas code can be much more concise that imperative logic in python, often achieving in few lines that would otherwise require complex functions;\n",
    "* Jupyter has native display and visualization support for pandas dataframes, making visual exploration much easier;\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose raw python objects over dataframes when:\n",
    "* complex conversion needs to be made that is not readily provided in Pandas;\n",
    "* fast random access is needed;"

    "#### Nested JSON and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "As anyone familiar with Suricata EVE format knows, it can be challenging to work with thanks to nested structure and sheer amount of fields. Suricata can log well over 1000 distinct JSON key-value pairs, omitting any that has been disabled in configuration or simply cannot be parsed from a particular flow. For example, a TLS 1.3 connection will for now most likely display a SNI (Server Name Indication) but will not have any certificate fields, as latter are simply not visible in plaintext network view. Sometimes a field only appears in handful of events, making it easy to overlook. Figuring out what is available to work on is a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a useful method `json_normalize` for normalizing nested JSON fields into dataframe. Resulting columns use dot notation to signify nested object, similar to how Elasticsearch does it. For example, `sni` key is part of `tls` section and would be accessible from column `tls.sni`. Missing values are noted as `np.nan`, or *not a number*, which is a statistical analysis convention. As mentioned, statistics is where pandas and underlying *numpy* libraries originated from. A measurement could simply be missing due to bad instrumentation, or it might be result of some algorithm that does not provide meaningful output is some scenarios. For example, dividing by zero is not allowed but nevertheless happens very easily in statistics. When trying to find a ratio between two measurements and second counter is 0, the only possible result is `NaN` as result `0` would be mathematically incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Not a number* is actually a special floating point value and a perfectly legal data type for vector computing. For Suricata, however, it simply means a missing value and likely has nothing to do with numeric measurements. Think of it as `null` or `None` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we still need some regular python code to parse individual EVE messages, as built-in pandas `read_json` would assume a full JSON structure rather than *newline delimited* JSON (NDJSON) log. Also note that this method reads all logs into memory and all further processing is also done there as well. Do not expect it to scale over gigabytes of data, unless of course you have access to a lot of RAM on single machine. It's meant for limited data exploration, quick prototyping, etc. Big data analytics when unable to fit into local memory requires supporting infrastructure."

    "\n",
    "A `describe` method is a useful shortcut for understanding statistical properties of numeric columns. It has limited value for NSM data, as most fields are either textual or categorical. Some numerical EVE values can not be analyzed like this, for example source and destination ports, randomly generated flow ID values, etc. However, it can provide great insights into `flow` and `stats` records, instantly revealing data properties such as distribution, max and min values, mean values, standard deviation, etc."

Some data science specific considerations will be explained, mostly to provide context to quirks when working with Pandas. We will not get into datamining or machine learning quite yet. Code examples assume that [MTA web scanning PCAP](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2022/01/03/2022-01-01-thru-03-server-activity-with-log4j-attempts.pcap.zip) has been downloaded, unpacked, and parsed with Suricata.\n",

    "I'm no stranger to teaching classroom courses, but one topic I always struggle to cover is threat hunting. Why? Because it is not a linear process, each hunting case can be vastly different, and each requires specialized knowledge. In other words, it's detective work where one always needs to consider new evidence. And picking up the right clues often comes down to *gut feeling*.\n",

    "Thus, if hunting requires case-by-case lessons, then let's start with the first one. We will explore web scanning dataset with the goal of revealing a high-profile Java exploit. For that purpose we need to:\n",

    "* understand basic web request logic;\n",
    "* understand how scanners work;\n",
    "* find the entry point to data exploration;\n",
    "* subset the NSM logs and pivot to correct records;\n",
    "* apply transformations to extract the exploit;\n",

    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly comes data preparation. This might sound like a small step, but is actually by far the most important. Data scientist can easily spend 80-90 per cent of working time here, and I believe that estimation to be accurate also for security analysts. After all, a organization should always be improving detection capabilities whenever not actively handling a ongoing incident, and that can technically be classified as data preparation. Even organizations that are constantly handling incident response cases, such as those that provide managed cyber security service to other companies, likely have dedicated staff for data and detection engineering. Indeed, even we in Stamus Networks spend most of our working days on data preparation, as we build and support a product that will be operated by our customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is data preparation? In practice, any operation that transforms or enriches existing data can be considered data preparation. But in data science, it refers to a collection of methods and techniques for collecting data, dealing with missing values, combining, restructuring, and in general *preparing* it for whatever algorithm the analyst wishes to apply. Of course, should that algorithm not produce meaningful result, then analyst would likely need to choose another and apply different preparation techniques as a result. Hence why researchers spend so much time here. \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison, threat hunter would follow a trail in data, only for it to reveal another trail. Sometimes the trail leads to information that does not exist, but can be derived from existing data. This is called pivoting. Experienced hunters know it to be normal part of the process, and best we can really do is prepare data to the best of our knowledge, accepting that eventually we always need to fall back to external analysis. Important thing is to try and ensure that next time we don't have to do the same work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post will try and present one of those hunting cases while explaining techniques we apply from both disciplines. Consider the following dataframe, does something seem wrong?"

    "Firstly, `flow_id` is formatted in scientific notation. In fact, pandas has converted this value into a floating point type, whereas anyone familiar with EVE JSON knows it's actually supposed to be a large randomly generated integer. This poses a big problem for flow correlation, as events generated for same flow will have identical `flow_id` to time them together. We need to be able to look up individual `flow_id` values, meaning we need to be able to copy them from the display. Quite difficult with a floating point number formatted in power of ten.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix that, we will simply apply a conversion over entire dataframe column, then replace the original column with transformed values. Note that columns can be selected both with method or dictionary notation. In other words `df.flow_id` and `df[\"flow_id\"]` are both valid. It's mostly a matter of preference, as method notation is cleaner and is mostly supported by IDE autocompletion. However, dictionary notation is needed in dynamic code, for example when looping over a dynamically generated list of columns. Method notation can also collide with built-in method or dataframe object parameter, so keep that in mind as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to do here is use `.astype` method to convert entire column of data into another type. If any single item fails, though, the entire conversion breaks. And indeed it will on this dataset, as full dataframe also contains Suricata `stats` events that lack `flow_id` key. A missing value can simply be omitted from JSON, but must be somehow represented in a vector. By default, pandas uses `NaN`, or *not a number* value. We have already established that `NaN` value is actually a special floating point and not a `null` or `None`. Problem is, other types have nothing equivalent, so `astype` conversion simply breaks. Here the workaround is trivial - we simply replace missing values with a zero, using `fillna` method. I call it *workaround* and not *solution* since replacing missing statistical measurements with zero values might not actually be a good idea. But here it's fine, as `flow_id` is not a measurement."

    "Similar conversions can be applied to other fields, such as source and destination ports. Likewise, they are not numerical measurements like bytes or packets tracked in flow statistics. Instead, it's *categorical* data, meaning they correspond to finite number of categories. Port numbers have possible values between `1` and `65535`, with low ports being assigned for services and high ports are dynamically used by clients connecting to them. For example, port `22` is used by SSH, port `53` is used by DNS, `80` is standard for unencrypted HTTP, `443` for encrypted HTTPS, etc. Calculating floating point statistics on those numbers would be pointless. But we can deduce useful information from the categories. A HTTP TLS connection to port other than 443 can be suspicious. Attackers might also try to exfiltrate data over port 53, as it's required for functional DNS and therefore not filtered by most organizations. Note that Suricata does not depend on port numbers for protocol detection. That's handled by application level parser. But, if Suricata parses any application level protocol on a well known port other than what it's actually assigned to, then it can safely be escalated as declaration of compromise. Like any non-DNS traffic on port 53. Analyst might also be interested in grouping traffic based on port ranges. For example, flow where both sides of the connection use high ephemeral ports can be considered suspicious or policy violations."

    "Also, we are only interested in columns that contain actual data. Alert event might not have full context, as Suricata emits this event as soon as possible. Other event types such as `http`, `smb`, or `flow` arrive later. Flow event might not be flushed until flow timeout, which by default is 10 minutes for TCP connections. In other words, flow records might arrive full 10 minutes after initial alert, or even later with higher timeout configuration. Alert records might hold data from flow, but it's incomplete. Flow `end` timestamp would be missing, for example, and would manifest as `NaN` value in the dataframe. In fact, if the dataframe is comprised only of alerts, then all `flow.end` values would be `NaN`. Why is that a problem? Since our subset dataframe would show all columns available in the original, yet most are just empty values. And display cannot fit all, so the view is truncated. Explicitly selecting columns with data would be tedious as we'd need to view each one to verify each, assuming the analyst is totally unfamiliar with the columns. Luckily we can use `drapna` method to remove columns where all values are `NaN` values. Thus, pandas pandas already does a lot of initial exploration for us."

    "Resulting dataframe still has 48 columns to explore. Reader might observe that some columns in the middle are even omitted. While we could override this behavior, the result would still be quite difficult to grasp visually. Better method would be to limit the column scope. In other words, select a small set of columns for initial exploration. Selecting following columns provides a fairly concise representation of alerts.\n",

    "We have already discussed `timestamp` and `flow_id`. Former is pretty intuitive, latter will be needed as a pivot point to more data. For alerts, I usually start with simply `alert.signature` when doing initial exploration. It is the description of the signature defined in rule `msg` option. `alert.category` is useful for additional context and contains the general categorization, such as network trojan, denial or service, network scan, policy violation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of `src_ip` and `dest_ip`, I have opted to display `flow.src_ip` and `flow.dest_ip`. Those are new fields added in Suricata 7 and are mainly relevant for analyzing `alert` event types. Why? Because signature can trigger in any direction. EVE NSM logs follows the direction of the flow. Client endpoint is `src_ip` and server is `dest_ip`. Alerts work differently. A rule could be written for either request or response traffic. For example, HTTP GET is part of HTTP request, wheres HTTP status code is part of response. Suricata rule parser does not even allow mixing those keywords in the same rule. A rule matching on the HTTP method would report client as `src_ip`, as expected. But rule written to match on HTTP status code would mark source of the one-sided response flow as the `src_ip`, which would actually reverse the IP pair since the source is server responding to request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has caused a lot of confusion for the analysts, as one always needs to translate what actually happened. Indeed, this is a big contributor to *alert fatigue* that our product in Stamus Networks is attempting to alleviate. Luckily, `flow.src_ip` and `flow.dest_ip` maintain the real source information from two-sided flow. Simply put, source and destination IP values are not flipped depending on the signature."

    "For this exercise, let's drill into [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) alerts. Why? All of the alerts within the set indicate scanning activity and are easily triggered by exploitation attempts. Emphasis on *attempt*. Usually that does not mean that target was compromised. Furthermore, a public service gets scanned all the time. Every few minutes for a small service. Larger ones might see more action than that! Anyone who has monitored public services is aware of this, and alerts like this mostly go ignored. These alerts are *not* false positives. They are simply boring. But not useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the scanners are disposable botnet nodes - compromised computers, proxy servers in the cloud, traffic originating from TOR nodes, etc. Not much interesting data we can extract there without the help of ISPs and police. Log4j exploits are slightly different, however. A lot has been published on this particular CVE, including in prior blog posts by Stamus Networks. So I will only present a quick recap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log4j is the standard logging library used in Java applications. That library is generally for writing entries into log files, but also supported evaluating commands. A malicious actor could trigger a log entry with special `jndi:` content, that would cause the logging library to evaluate it as system command. This is known as RCE, or Remote Command Injection, allowing remote user to essentially execute commands on remote system. Vulnerability was quickly dubbed *Log4shell*. Since interacting with a remote application entirely via requests triggering log entries is a bit of a hassle, the typical use-case would be to inject a small payload that would connect to remote infrastructure or download malicious payloads. Essentially working as stage 1 downloader or initialization if command and control communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would be interesting to extract this payload and see what is being injected. Perhaps even reveal malicious c2 infrastructure behind it! These are the alerts we are investigating."

In other words, parsing the same PCAP multiple times would result in different `flow_id` values every time, even if actual events remain the same.\n",

A nice trick is also to pass this column array into a pandas dataframe to leverage nice Jupyter display."

    "In addition to columns we explored before, the following fields can reveal useful information:\n",

    "* `http.url` is the website path following hostname. Here we observe that instead of a typical website path, such as `index.html`, it instantly tries to inject a LDAP query via previously mentioned `jndi` prefix.\n",

Malicious requests can can inject arbitrary values here, and here it serves as secondary injection point. One can observe how it seems to attempt to bypass ldap query sanitation by evaluating lowercase letters."

But it's good enough, and any good SoC engineer knows that sometimes a simple trick can save the day. Function can be passed directly into pandas `apply` method, which would in turn execute it for every value on required column. As we've already seen, a value could be missing or simply not contain interesting values. Our function would return numpy `NaN` in those cases, as that's how pandas usually denotes missing values. Note that we need to use `pd.isna` or `pd.isnull` functions since `NaN` is a special floating point value that has to be matched correctly. Python programmers that are used to relying on `is None` checks might get a bad surprise otherwise.\n",
